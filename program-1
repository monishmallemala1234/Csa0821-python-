Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they
add up to the target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.



def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_indices = {}

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_indices:
            return [num_indices[complement], i]
        num_indices[num] = i

    return []


nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))
