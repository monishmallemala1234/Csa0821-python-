The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0’s to 1’s and all the 1’s to 0’s
in its binary representation. Given an integer num, return its complement

  def findComplement(num): 
    num_bits = num.bit_length()
    bitmask = (1 << num_bits) - 1
    complement = num ^ bitmask
    return complement

# Test the function
num = 5
print(findComplement(num))
