We define the usage of capitals in a word as right when one of the following cases holds: All letters in
this word are capitals, like ”USA”. All letters in this word are not capitals, like ”demo”. Only the first
letter in this word is capitalized, like ”Google”. Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals
in it is proper.

def detectCapitalUse(word):
    # Case 1: All letters in the word are capitals
    if word.isupper():
        return True

    # Case 2: All letters in the word are not capitals
    if word.islower():
        return True

    # Case 3: Only the first letter in the word is capitalized
    if word[0].isupper() and word[1:].islower():
        return True

    return False

# Test the function
word1 = "USA"
word2 = "demo"
word3 = "Google"
print(detectCapitalUse(word1))  # Output: True
print(detectCapitalUse(word2))  # Output: True
print(detectCapitalUse(word3))  # Output: True
