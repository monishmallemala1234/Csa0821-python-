The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such
that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.


  def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]

    if n <= 1:
        return fib_sequence[:n+1]

    for i in range(2, n+1):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])

    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
n = 10
print(fibonacci(n))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
