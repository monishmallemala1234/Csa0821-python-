Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The
returned integer should be non-negative as well. It would help if you did not use any built-in exponent
function or operator.



def my_sqrt(x: int) -> int:
    if x == 0 or x == 1:
        return x

    left, right = 1, x

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        square = mid * mid

        if square == x:
            return mid
        elif square < x:
            left = mid + 1
            result = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return result

# Test cases
print(my_sqrt(4))   
print(my_sqrt(8))  
print(my_sqrt(9))   
print(my_sqrt(16))
